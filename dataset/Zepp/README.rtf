\f0\fs24 \cf0 Introduction:\
\
LLM has recently showed promising results in time series analysis. \
This recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01728) introduces a novel method of tokenizing time series to input to LLM.\
This paper is designed for time series forecasting task and comes with a repo where the codes are provided.\
\
Assignment:\
\
The assignment is to modify the above mentioned code and make it work for a binary classification task.\
For this binary classification task, we have time series data from accelerometer in 3 axis and a binary label of 0 or 1. Training and test data are already separated. The accelerometer data is sampled at 25Hz, and each row of data shows data over non-overlapping 30s window. Please modify the code to take in this data and run the pipeline. \
\
Deliverable:\
\
Write a report about you approach, your results and deliver that with your code. \
\
Hint: if you are limited by the resources, please be innovative to reduce the model size, data, etc to make sure the code run. \
If there is any ambiguity please make proper assumptions and mention that in your report.}
